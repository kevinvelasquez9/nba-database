The way that player statistics are structured on basketball-reference.com makes it difficult to download and combine all player info into one text file. We must use a script / API in order to facilitate downloading all player statistics to one file.

We ended up using BeautifulSoup and Pandas to go through pages and scrape the tables (since we cannot simply download a csv).

One issue we have is that player names with accents will sometimes show up weird on the csv.

Another issue is the inconsistency in player names and team names. For example, in some of our sources Lebron James would be listed as L. James instead of his full name. This proved to be very difficult in handling our foreign key constraints.

Hence, we have two sets of setup: one with the proper schema and without foreign keys. The proper schema is our ultimate goal however this data cleaning has become a challenge so we worked without foreign keys to strive for no errors.
