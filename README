The way that player statistics are structured on basketball-reference.com makes it difficult to download and combine all player info into one text file. We must use a script / API in order to facilitate downloading all player statistics to one file.

We ended up using BeautifulSoup and Pandas to go through pages and scrape the tables (since we cannot simply download a csv).

One issue we have is that player names with accents will sometimes show up weird on the csv.
